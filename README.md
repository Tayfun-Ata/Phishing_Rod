This is a gmail Phishing detector.

If you are having issues:

You must set an app password if you have 2-step verification.

  In GMAIL settings:
    (Enable your POP download | This option allows you to download emails from Gmail to a client (like Outlook or Thunderbird) using the POP (Post Office Protocol). POP downloads emails from the Gmail server to your device, typically removing them from the server. It's useful for offline access but may not sync changes (like read/unread status) across devices.)
    (Enable IMAP | This option allows you to access Gmail emails using IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), which keeps your emails synchronized across multiple devices. When you read, delete, or organize emails in a client, those changes are reflected in Gmail and vice versa. It's ideal for accessing the same mailbox on multiple devices.)
